background : differences in responses to bacterial surface lipopolysaccharides ( lpss ) are apparent between and within mammalian species . it has been shown in mice that resistance to lps is caused by defects in the toll - like receptor 4 gene ( tlr4 ) , the product of which is thought to bind lps and mediate lps signal transduction in immune system cells.results:we have sequenced the toll - like receptor 4 gene of humans ( tlr4 ; 19.0 kilobases , kb ) and mice ( tlr4 ; 91.7 kb ) , as well as the coding region and splice junctions of tlr4 from 35 mouse ( mus musculus ) strains , from the chimpanzee and from the baboon . no other discernible genes or regions of interspecies conservation lies close to tlr4 and , in both humans and mice , flanking sequences and introns are rich in repeats of retroviral origin . interstrain analyses reveal that tlr4 is a polymorphic protein and that the extracellular domain is far more variable than the cytoplasmic domain , both among strains and among species . the cytoplasmic domain of the tlr4 protein is highly variable at the carboxy - terminal end.conclusions:we suggest that selective evolutionary pressure exerted by microbes expressing structurally distinguishable lps molecules has produced the high level of variability in the tlr4 extracellular domain . the highly variable carboxy - terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain is likely to determine the magnitude of the response to lps within a species .
