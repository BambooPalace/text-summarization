backgroundthe existence of a constitutively expressed machinery for death in individual cells has led to the notion that survival factors repress this machinery and , if such factors are unavailable , cells die by default . in many cells , however , mrna and protein synthesis inhibitors induce apoptosis , suggesting that in some cases transcriptional activity might actually impede cell death . to identify transcriptional mechanisms that interfere with cell death and survival , we combined gene trap mutagenesis with site - specific recombination ( cre / loxp system ) to isolate genes from cells undergoing apoptosis by growth factor deprivation.resultsfrom an integration library consisting of approximately 2  106 unique proviral integrations obtained by infecting the interleukin-3 ( il-3)-dependent hematopoietic cell line - floxil3 - with u3cre gene trap virus , we have isolated 125 individual clones that converted to factor independence upon il-3 withdrawal . of 102 cellular sequences adjacent to u3cre integration sites , 17% belonged to known genes , 11% matched single expressed sequence tags ( ests ) or full cdnas with unknown function and 72% had no match within the public databases . most of the known genes recovered in this analysis encoded proteins with survival functions.conclusionswe have shown that hematopoietic cells undergoing apoptosis after withdrawal of il-3 activate survival genes that impede cell death . this results in reduced apoptosis and improved survival of cells treated with a transient apoptotic stimulus . thus , apoptosis in hematopoietic cells is the end result of a conflict between death and survival signals , rather than a simple death by default .
