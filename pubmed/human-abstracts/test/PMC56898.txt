backgroundmost organisms have developed ways to recognize and interact with other species . symbiotic interactions range from pathogenic to mutualistic . some molecular mechanisms of interspecific interaction are well understood , but many remain to be discovered . expressed sequence tags ( ests ) from cultures of interacting symbionts can help identify transcripts that regulate symbiosis , but present a unique challenge for functional analysis . given a sequence expressed in an interaction between two symbionts , the challenge is to determine from which organism the transcript originated . for high - throughput sequencing from interaction cultures , a reliable computational approach is needed . previous investigations into gc nucleotide content and comparative similarity searching provide provisional solutions , but a comparative lexical analysis , which uses a likelihood - ratio test of hexamer counts , is more powerful.resultsvalidation with genes whose origin and function are known yielded 94% accuracy . microbial ( non - plant ) transcripts comprised 75% of a phytophthora sojae - infected soybean ( glycine max cv harasoy ) library , contrasted with 15% or less in root tissue libraries of medicago truncatula from axenic , phytophthora medicaginis - infected , mycorrhizal , and rhizobacterial treatments . mycorrhizal libraries contained about 23% microbial transcripts ; an axenic plant library contained a similar proportion of putative microbial transcripts.conclusionscomparative lexical analysis offers numerous advantages over alternative approaches . many of the transcripts isolated from mixed cultures were of unknown function , suggesting specificity to symbiotic metabolism and therefore candidates likely to be interesting for further functional investigation . future investigations will determine whether the abundance of non - plant transcripts in a pure plant library indicates procedural artifacts , horizontally transferred genes , or other phenomena .
