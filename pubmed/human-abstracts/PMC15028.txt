background : the embl nucleotide sequence database is a comprehensive database of dna and rna sequences and related information traditionally made available in flat - file format . queries through tools such as srs ( sequence retrieval system ) also return data in flat - file format . flat files have a number of shortcomings , however , and the resources therefore currently lack a flexible environment to meet individual researchers ' needs . the object management group 's common object request broker architecture ( corba ) is an industry standard that provides platform - independent programming interfaces and models for portable distributed object - oriented computing applications . its independence from programming languages , computing platforms and network protocols makes it attractive for developing new applications for querying and distributing biological data.results:a corba infrastructure developed by embl - ebi provides an efficient means of accessing and distributing embl data . the embl object model is defined such that it provides a basis for specifying interfaces in interface definition language ( idl ) and thus for developing the corba servers . the mapping from the object model to the relational schema in the underlying oracle database uses the facilities provided by persistencetm , an object / relational tool . the techniques of developing loaders and ' live object caching ' with persistent objects achieve a smart live object cache where objects are created on demand . the objects are managed by an evictor pattern mechanism.conclusions:the corba interfaces to the embl database address some of the problems of traditional flat - file formats and provide an efficient means for accessing and distributing embl data . corba also provides a flexible environment for users to develop their applications by building clients to our corba servers , which can be integrated into existing systems .
