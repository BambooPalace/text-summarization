background : whole - genome comparisons can provide great insight into many aspects of biology . until recently , however , comparisons were mainly possible only between distantly related species . complete genome sequences are now becoming available from multiple sets of closely related strains or species.results:by comparing the recently completed genome sequences of vibrio cholerae , 						 streptococcus pneumoniae and mycobacterium tuberculosis to those of closely related species - escherichia coli , streptococcus pyogenes and mycobacterium leprae , respectively - we have identified an unusual and previously unobserved feature of bacterial genome structure . scatterplots of the conserved sequences ( both dna and protein ) between each pair of species produce a distinct x - shaped pattern , which we call an x - alignment . the key feature of these alignments is that they have symmetry around the replication origin and terminus ; that is , the distance of a particular conserved feature ( dna or protein ) from the replication origin ( or terminus ) is conserved between closely related pairs of species . statistically significant x - alignments are also found within some genomes , indicating that there is symmetry about the replication origin for paralogous features as well.conclusions:the most likely mechanism of generation of x - alignments involves large chromosomal inversions that reverse the genomic sequence symmetrically around the origin of replication . the finding of these x - alignments between many pairs of species suggests that chromosomal inversions around the origin are a common feature of bacterial genome evolution .
