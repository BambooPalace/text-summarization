background : the formin family of proteins has been implicated in signaling pathways of cellular morphogenesis in both animals and fungi ; in the latter case , at least , they participate in communication between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell surface . nevertheless , they appear to be cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins , and it is not clear whether they communicate with the plasma membrane , and if so , how . because nothing is known about formin function in plants , i performed a systematic search for putative arabidopsis thaliana formin homologs.results:i found eight putative formin - coding genes in the publicly available part of the arabidopsis genome sequence and analyzed their predicted protein sequences . surprisingly , some of them lack parts of the conserved formin - homology 2 ( fh2 ) domain and the majority of them seem to have signal sequences and putative transmembrane segments that are not found in yeast or animals formins.conclusions:plant formins define a distinct subfamily . the presence in most arabidopsis formins of sequence motifs typical or transmembrane proteins suggests a mechanism of membrane attachment that may be specific to plant formins , and indicates an unexpected evolutionary flexibility of the conserved formin domain .
