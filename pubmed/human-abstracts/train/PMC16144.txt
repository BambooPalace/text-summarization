background : genome comparisons have revealed major lateral gene transfer between the three primary kingdoms of life - bacteria , archaea , and eukarya . another important evolutionary phenomenon involves the evolutionary mobility of protein domains that form versatile multidomain architectures . we were interested in investigating the possibility of a combination of these phenomena , with an invading gene merging with a pre - existing gene in the recipient genome.results:complete genomes of fifteen bacteria , four archaea and one eukaryote were searched for interkingdom gene fusions ( ikfs ) ; that is , genes coding for proteins that apparently consist of domains originating from different primary kingdoms . phylogenetic analysis supported 37 cases of ikf , each of which includes a ' native ' domain and a horizontally acquired ' alien ' domain . ikfs could have evolved via lateral transfer of a gene coding for the alien domain ( or a larger protein containing this domain ) followed by recombination with a native gene . for several ikfs , this scenario is supported by the presence of a gene coding for a second , stand - alone version of the alien domain in the recipient genome . among the genomes investigated , the greatest number of ikfs has been detected in mycobacterium tuberculosis , where they are almost always accompanied by a stand - alone alien domain . for most of the ikf cases detected in other genomes , the stand - alone counterpart is missing.conclusions:the results of comparative genome analysis show that ikf formation is a real , but relatively rare , evolutionary phenomenon . we hypothesize that ikfs are formed primarily via the proposed two - stage mechanism , but other than in the actinomycetes , in which ikf generation seems to be an active , ongoing process , most of the stand - alone intermediates have been eliminated , perhaps because of functional redundancy .
