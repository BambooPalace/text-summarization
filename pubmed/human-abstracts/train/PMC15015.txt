background : large gene expression studies , such as those conducted using dna arrays , often provide millions of different pieces of data . to address the problem of analyzing such data , we describe a statistical method , which we have called ' gene shaving ' . the method identifies subsets of genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across conditions . gene shaving differs from hierarchical clustering and other widely used methods for analyzing gene expression studies in that genes may belong to more than one cluster , and the clustering may be supervised by an outcome measure . the technique can be ' unsupervised ' , that is , the genes and samples are treated as unlabeled , or partially or fully supervised by using known properties of the genes or samples to assist in finding meaningful groupings.results:we illustrate the use of the gene shaving method to analyze gene expression measurements made on samples from patients with diffuse large b - cell lymphoma . the method identifies a small cluster of genes whose expression is highly predictive of survival.conclusions:the gene shaving method is a potentially useful tool for exploration of gene expression data and identification of interesting clusters of genes worth further investigation .
