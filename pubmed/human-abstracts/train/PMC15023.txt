background : for most vertebrate organs and tissues , the majority of development occurs during embryogenesis , and postnatal changes are primarily concerned with growth . the central nervous system is unusual in that a considerable amount of morphological development , cell differentiation and acquisition of function , takes place during postnatal development . as yet , the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex developmental processes are not well understood . in order to identify markers for these developmental processes , we have analyzed the expression profiles , during postnatal murine brain development , of approximately 25,000 transcripts . this analysis , performed at day 1 , day 10 , day 20 and day 42 of postnatal development , identified a large number of developmentally regulated genes which we have assigned into three broad expression categories.results:expression levels at four timepoints during postnatal murine brain development were established for approximately 25,000 gene transcripts . approximately 1% of the genes examined displayed a developmentally regulated pattern of expression and we provide all the necessary information required to easily obtain molecular markers for a subset of these developmentally regulated transcripts . of this subset , 61 showed increasing expression during development , 61 showed decreasing expression during development , and 9 exhibited a peak of expression during this period.conclusions:a small percentage of the genes expressed in the postnatal developing brain show changes in expression level during the newborn to adult phase of development . it is likely that these developmentally regulated transcripts represent molecular markers for the complex developmental process occurring in the postnatal brain .
