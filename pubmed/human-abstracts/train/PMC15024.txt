background : the germ cell nuclear factor ( gcnf , also known as retinoid acid receptor - related testis - associated receptor , neuronal cell nuclear receptor or nr6a1 ) is an orphan receptor in the nuclear receptor superfamily found in mammals , amphibians and fish . the mouse gcnf gene is expressed in the placenta and the developing nervous system and germ cells , and responds to retinoic acid.results:we have defined the intron - exon structure of the mouse gcnf gene and found that it contains 11 exons . exons 1 - 4 encode the 75 amino acid amino - terminal domain and exon 4 also encodes the core dna - binding domain . the carboxy - terminal extension is encoded by exon 5 , exons 6 and 7 encode the hinge region , and exons 7 - 11 encode the putative ligand - binding domain . unusually , the two zinc - finger motifs in the dna - binding domain are encoded by separate exons.conclusions:the protein - coding region of gcnf is contained in 11 exons . the genomic structure of this nuclear receptor gene will be useful for further studies .
