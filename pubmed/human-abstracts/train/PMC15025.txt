background : uracil dna glycosylases ( udgs ) are major repair enzymes that protect dna from mutational damage caused by uracil incorporated as a result of a polymerase error or deamination of cytosine . four distinct families of udgs have been identified , which show very limited sequence similarity to each other , although two of them have been shown to possess the same structural fold . the structural and evolutionary relationships between the rest of the udgs remain uncertain.results:using sequence profile searches , multiple alignment analysis and protein structure comparisons , we show here that all known udgs possess the same fold and must have evolved from a common ancestor . although all udgs catalyze essentially the same reaction , significant changes in the configuration of the catalytic residues were detected within their common fold , which probably results in differences in the biochemistry of these enzymes . the extreme sequence divergence of the udgs , which is unusual for enzymes with the same principal activity , is probably due to the major role of the uracil - flipping caused by the conformational strain enacted by the enzyme on uracil - containing dna , as compared with the catalytic action of individual polar residues . we predict two previously undetected families of udgs and delineate a hypothetical scenario for their evolution.conclusions:udgs form a single protein superfamily with a distinct structural fold and a common evolutionary origin . differences in the catalytic mechanism of the different families combined with the construction of the catalytic pocket have , however , resulted in extreme sequence divergence of these enzymes .
