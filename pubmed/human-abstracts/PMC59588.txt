the prognosis of patients who present with non - st segment elevation acute coronary syndromes ( acs ) is guarded . these patients can be risk - stratified on the basis of symptom complex , electrocardiographic st segment depression , obvious hemodynamic compromise and particularly on the basis of serum troponin level . an elevated troponin level determines risk and also predicts the degree of benefit from treatment with either low molecular weight heparin or platelet glycoprotein ( gp ) iib / iiia blockade . higher risk patients should undergo early coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization as indicated and feasible . although studies performed before the advent of coronary stenting and adjunctive platelet gp iib / iiia blockade suggested increased hazard for patients undergoing early intervention , recent experience cited herein supports an in - hospital and long - term clinical benefit for the aggressive approach . here , i propose an algorithm for risk stratification and triage of appropriate patients for adjunctive pharmacotherapy and early revascularization .
