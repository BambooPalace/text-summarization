background : white spotting patterns in mammals can be caused by mutations in the genes for the endothelin b receptor and c - kit , whose protein products are necessary for proper migration , differentiation or survival of the melanoblast population of cells . although there are many different dog breeds that segregate white spotting patterns , no genes have been identified that are linked to these phenotypes.results:an intercross was generated from a female newfoundland and a male border collie and the white spotting phenotypes of the intercross progeny were evaluated by measuring percentage surface area of white in the puppies . the border collie markings segregated as a simple autosomal recessive ( 7/25 intercross progeny had the phenotype ) . two candidate genes , for the endothelin b receptor ( ednrb ) and c - kit ( kit ) , were evaluated for segregation with the white spotting pattern . polymorphisms between the border collie and newfoundland were identified for ednrb using southern analysis after a portion of the canine gene had been cloned . polymorphisms for kit were identified using a microsatellite developed from a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the canine gene.conclusions:both ednrb and kit were excluded as a cause of the white spotting pattern in at least two of the intercross progeny . although these genes have been implicated in white spotting in other mammals , including horses , pigs , cows , mice and rats , they do not appear to be responsible for the white spotting pattern found in the border collie breed of dog .
